# Docker Compose TUI

A lightweight terminal UI for Docker Compose, written in **Go**.  
This project is primarily a **learning experiment** to practice Go and terminal UI development, so some parts are rough or experimental.

Heavily **inspired by [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)**, but focused on Docker Compose instead of Kubernetes.
